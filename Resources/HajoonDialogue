Hajoon: Oh, hi there! We... may not really know eachother properly, but do you want any help?\n    yes/no
Hajoon: Uh- Slow down! I didn't quite catch that, sorry!-
Hajoon: Oh, alright! See you some other time then?
Hajoon: Okay! Soo... There's, I think some clues and notes hidden in some rooms. Those can be unlocked by... I think keys, or maybe even moving items? Not so sure about that one.
Hajoon: Hi-hi again! Is there anything else you wanted?\n    You can choose to compliment (command compliment), insult him (command insult) or give him a gift if you have one (command gift).
Hajoon: Ouch! That hurt! What's gotten into you?
Hajoon: Hehe- well if you think so, then it must be true!
Hajoon: Wh- oh! A gift! I really didn't expect that, thank you!
Hajoon: Hii! What can I do for my best friend?\n    hint/talk
Hajoon: Huh, well... I don't know what else to say- Ohh, wait! I think the garden and the gallery each have secret rooms!
Hajoon: You just wanna talk? Well, I'd love to! But I'm not really feeling up to it at the moment, maybe some other time?
Hajoon: Uhh, hii!- I can't really talk right now-
Hajoon: ... C'mon, are you deaf? I said I can't talk right now.
