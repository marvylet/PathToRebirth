Orson: Can you just quit it?\n    You can choose to compliment (command compliment), insult him (command insult) or give him a gift if you have one (command gift).
Orson: I feel the same way about you.
Orson: You don't have to keep feeding people up with lies.
Orson: Look, I don't want your little pitiful attempts of gifts. I don't care.
Orson: Didn't hear that, and I'm kinda glad.
Orson: Finally we share something together.
Orson: Y'know, you were not much of a saint. There's a reason you're here after all.
Orson: ... Not all of it is entirely my fault. You should realise that.
