Ezra: ... Leave me alone.
Ezra: Didn't you hear me!? I said leave me alone!
Ezra: ... Just go.
Ezra: ...
Ezra: ... Fine. What do you want? Since you can't seem to just leave me be..\n    You can choose to compliment (command compliment), insult him (command insult) or give him a gift if you have one (command gift).

Ezra: W- what? Uh... okay? I guess?
Ezra: Huh? Is this... uh... thank- you...?
Ezra: Hey!- Uhh... you probably already know this, but- I think you can move some items... to unlock rooms?
Ezra: ... By the way, thank you... for- giving me a chance.

Ezra: ... Wait, what? Can you talk more- what's the word... comprehensible?
